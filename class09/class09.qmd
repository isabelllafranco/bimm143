## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
data=read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
data
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data$X.ray)))
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data$EM)))
```

How can we write a function so that we do not have to write the same thing over and over again.

```{r}
#I will work with `x` as input

  sum_comma <- function(data) {
  
  
    (sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data))))
  }


```

For X.ray:

```{r}
sum_comma(data$X.ray)/ sum_comma(data$Total)
```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(data$EM)/ sum_comma(data$Total),2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
sum_comma(data$Total[1])
```

This is our protein total!

```{r}
round(sum_comma(data$Total[1])/sum_comma(data$Total),2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

2,064 HIV-1 protease structures

> Q3. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this picture?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 angstrom resolution to see H.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

#Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb<-read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)

```{r}
#perform flexibility predictions
m<-nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (aka trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOlstar
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
 
 198
 
>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH


>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains
