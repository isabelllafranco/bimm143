#Comparitive Analysis of ADK

ADK is an important drug target and we would love to know how it works- i.e. molecular mechanism.

There has been lots of work done on this protein due to it's importance inclusing lots of crystal structures.

We will begin with getting an example ADK sequence from the database

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```


We can now run BLAST with this sequence
```{r}
#b<-blast.pdb(aa)
```
We can run `hits`
```{r}
#hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
#hits$pdb.id

hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

Now we can download  all these PDB strcture files:
```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```



Now I want to align and supperpose these structures which are all over the place.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Let's have a look at out `pdbs` object.

```{r}
pdbs
```

Now we have our aligned and superposed structures we can perform all sorts of analysis on them.  Let's do PCA...

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
Results of PCA on Adenylate kinase X-ray structures. Each dot represents one PDB structure.

We can cluster the structures by RMSD (or any other method).

```{r}
rd<-rmsd(pdbs)

hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps<- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray,1:2, col=grps)
```

We can make a wee movie- also called a trajectory of the major differences (i.e. structural displacements) of ADK

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
